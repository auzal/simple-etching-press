## Bill of materials

All dimensions expressed in millimeters. Any part marked "(x2)" means that two copies of it are needed.

Many of these dimensions are approximate. The first prototype for this press was made without measuring dimensions, only keeping in mind the size relationship between parts.

## Assembly steps

1 - Take base (A) and glue parts B, E and G as shown. These parts can also be secured with flat head wood screws from below. Make sure they are flush to the bottom of the base so that the press can have a level and stable surface to sit on.

2 - Glue bottom plate (F) to the previous assembly, centered in the space left between parts E and G.

**Notes:**

- The internal faces of the plates (F) need to be as flat as possible. If using plywood, make sure you sand them down before assembling. This will help achieving an even pressure across the plate. 

- The washers used as padding against the handle (D) can be replaced with sections of hose or copper pipe.
